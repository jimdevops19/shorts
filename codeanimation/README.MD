# How to animate code typing ?

## Steps:

 - Paste the code you want to animate inside the code.txt file
   - Warning: words like self in Python are auto completed. So in the example of the given code.txt, I did not include self as a param.
 - Start the python file named `original_code.py`
 - Minimize all opened files, focus on `scene.py`
 - Once the output of `STARTING IN ... ` reaches 1 sec, computer fill start sending keys to the focused page.
